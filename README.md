### üöÄ Features

- Standard arcs covered (note that not _all_ OIDS are necessarily exported):
  - ANSI X9.62
  - PKCS #1
  - PKCS #5 (PBKDF2 only)
  - PKCS #7 / CMS
  - PKCS #9
  - RSA digest algorithms (MD2, MD5, etc.) and HMAC (HMAC with SHA-*)
  - NIST AES
  - NIST SHA
- Incudes `JSDoc` with a description.
- It does _not_ support reverse lookups.
